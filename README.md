## 🧐 Why this tool?
In a global economy, it's hard to realize the true value of money.
- **The Problem:** A $100 USD item on an American site might look like "5 hours" of work if you earn $20/h. But if your salary is in CAD, it actually costs you **~7 hours**.
- **The Solution:** TimeCurrency detects the website's currency, applies the daily exchange rate, adds your local taxes, and reveals the TRUE cost in work hours.

## 🚀 V1 Features (Pro)

### 1. 🌎 Smart International Conversion
Shop anywhere.
If your wage is in **CAD** and the store is in **USD**, **EUR**, or **GBP**, the extension automatically handles the math and currency conversion before calculating your hours.

### 2. 📉 Real Cost Calculation (Taxes)
Configure your local tax rate (e.g., 15% in Quebec, 20% in France).
> *Visual Indicator:* The icon changes to `⏱+` to show that taxes are included in the calculation.

### 3. 🛑 Budget Alert (Responsibility)
Set a monthly "Hours Budget".
If a single purchase takes up too much of your budget (e.g., >10%), the badge turns **RED** to warn you.

### 4. 🗣 Multilingual (i18n)
The extension automatically detects your browser language (English or French).

## 🔒 Privacy & Security
- **100% Local:** Your wage and preferences are stored strictly on your device.
- **Exchange Rate API:** The extension connects once a day to a public API to fetch rates. No user data is ever sent.
- **GPLv3 License:** The code is Open Source and protected against proprietary theft.
